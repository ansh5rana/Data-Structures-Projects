Rising Tides: Visualizing the Impact of Sea Level Rise on Global Cities

Background/Inspiration
Climate change and the consequent rise in sea levels present a significant challenge to coastal and low-lying areas worldwide. The "Rising Tides" project was inspired by the need to understand and visualize the impact of these environmental changes on various terrains, particularly major cities. Utilizing 2-D arrays to represent geographical terrains, this project aims to simulate how rising sea levels could affect different regions, highlighting areas at risk of flooding. Through the interactive user interface, users can dynamically adjust water heights to see real-time flooding simulations, making the impacts of climate change more tangible and understandable. This project serves as both an educational tool and a call to action, emphasizing the importance of addressing climate change to protect vulnerable habitats.

# RU Hungry: Simulating Restaurant Management with Data Structures

Background/Inspiration
RU Hungry is a fictional restaurant management simulation inspired by the iconic restaurant RU Hungry in downtown New Brunswick. In the project, the user is tasked with operating a virtual restaurant for a day and has to manage the restaurant's menu, stock, and transactions. This program uses data structures like hash tables and linked lists to simulate managing a restaurant. This project also serves a dual purpose of educating users on the complex world of restaurant management while raising awareness about food insecurity among college students.

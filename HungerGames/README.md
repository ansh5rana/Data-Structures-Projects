# Hunger Games: A Binary Search Tree Simulation

Inspired by the dystopian universe of the Hunger Games, this prjects transports users to the fictional world of Panem, where the Hunger Games, an event in which participants compete in a fight to the death, is an annual occurrence. Unlike the original focus on survival, strategy, and the socio-political tensions, this project focuses on using binary search trees to manage the Hunger Games. This unique approach not only engages students with a popular cultural reference but also deepens their understanding of binary search trees and their applications in organizing and accessing data efficiently.

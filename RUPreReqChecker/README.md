Prerequisite Checker: A Graphical Approach to Course Planning

Navigating through the complex web of course prerequisites can be a daunting task for students. This project, inspired by the course offerings in the Rutgers Computer Science program, helps simplify this process. Using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to map out relationships between courses and their prerequisites, this project aims to provide an east to understand way to visualize course prerequisites, allowing students to effectively plan their academic journey.
